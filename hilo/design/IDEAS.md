ideas
=============
* [ ] preset save/restore
* [ ] ii control of clock when free running
  * [ ] sync to set playhead
  * [ ] slew to tempo over time value (should lock to multiple? of clock so as to be "in time" when the goal is reached)
  * [ ] grid button to re-enable clock input and/or parameter kob
* [ ] some sort of swing? (requires fine grain trigger timing)
* [ ] fine grain shifting of triggers 8x "zoom" edit for one step
* [ ] per track play heads, in and out points (per track freeze, unfreeze of playhead)
* [ ] set looping on non-page boundries (i.e. step)
* [ ] trigger vs gate mode?
* [ ] per track play mode
  * [ ] normal, looping (in to out)
  * [ ] one shot (from in to out), manual trigger
* [ ] per track rate multiplier/divider (i.e. one track runs at 1/4 rate)
* [ ] copy paste
  * [ ] one page to another in same track
  * [ ] ... between different tracks
* [ ] queued preset change
* [ ] tt command support (similar to ww?)
* [ ] page / track quick erase
* [ ] full track shift? (by step?, by page?)
* [ ] track groups; a gate high in one track causes gates on all other tracks to go low with lowest track number winning when multiple triggers happen on same step
* [ ] track priority or ducking, i.e higher tracks don't trigger if lower track is high
